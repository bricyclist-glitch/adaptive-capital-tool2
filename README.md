⚡ Adaptive Capital Analyzer
Relational assessment across nested system scales
🎯 Purpose
This tool maps investment opportunities across three nested panarchy cycles to understand phase relationships, cross-scale dynamics, and appropriate adaptive capital behavior.

🏢
Level 1: SFI Product Cycle Position
Where is this organization in its adaptive cycle?
Current Phase (best guess)
r - Growth
Exploring, adapting
K - Conservation
Optimizing, scaling
Ω - Release
Disruption, crisis
α - Reorganization
Innovating, recombining
Innovation Rate (experimentation vs. optimization)
Optimizing existing
Rapid experimentation
Connectedness (how tightly coupled are operations?)
Loosely coupled
Highly integrated
High connectedness in K-phase = potential brittleness
Resilience Signals (diversity of revenue, slack resources, adaptive capacity)
Fragile/brittle
Highly resilient
Precise Position in Cycle (0-360°)
r start (0°)
45°
back to r (360°)
r: 0-90° | K: 90-180° | Ω: 180-270° | α: 270-360°
Time in Current Phase (months)
Longer time = higher transition probability
Transition Signals (signs of approaching phase shift)
Revenue growth plateauing Increased team turnover Innovation rate slowing External market pressures mounting Diminishing efficiency gains Rising customer churn New competitive threats emerging Technology disruption visible Regulatory environment shifting Capital becoming constrained
